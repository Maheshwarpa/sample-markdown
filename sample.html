        <h4> 
            MODESTY BY PAUL HERVIEU
        </h4>
        
        <p class="speech"> <h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> But you already possess every imaginable quality! You are
charitable, cultured, refined----</p><br>

<p><h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5></p><p class="direction"> [_Annoyed._]</p><p> Please!</p>

    <p class="direction"> [_Turns away and sits on settee._ JACQUES _addresses her from
     behind chair_.</p>

     <p class="speech"> <h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> You are discreet, witty----</p>

     <p class="speech"><h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5> The same old compliments! Everybody tells me that. I want to
be preached to, contradicted, scolded----</p>

<p class="speech"><h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> You could never stand _that_.</p>

<p class="speech"><h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5>Yes, I could. I should be happy to profit by the criticism.
It would inspire me.</p>

<p class="speech"><h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> I'd like to see the man who has the audacity to criticise you
to your face----</p>

<p class="speech"><h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5> That is enough! I trust you are aware that you are not the
person fit to exercise this influence over me?</p>

<p class="speech"><h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> How could I? Everything about you pleases me. It can never be
otherwise.</p>

<p class="speech"><h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5> How interesting! That's the very reason I rejected your
proposal. I sha'n't marry until I am certain that I shall not be
continually pestered with compliments and flattery and submission. The
man who marries me shall make it his business to remind me of my
shortcomings, to correct all my mistakes. He must give me the assurance
that I am continually bettering myself.</p>

<p class="speech"><h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> And this--husband--have you found him already?</p>

<p class="speech"><h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5> What--? Oh, who knows?</p>

<p class="speech"><h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> Perhaps it's--Albert?</p>
